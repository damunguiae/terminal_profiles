Hi, I created this repository to share my appearance's settings for some Windows Terminal profiles that I use. You can use them if you like them, just copy the JSON from each folder into your profile's list inside the settings.json file in your system.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Please remember to replace the value of the fields I indicate in every .json file. You have put your own stuff like GUID, name, and source/command line, etc.
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Also, there are some profiles where I use <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch">Neofetch</a>, so I will put the command that I use to display what you see in the examples with custom ASCII that I found on the internet. The ASCII file can be found in their respective folder.
</div>


## Examples
___
Here what should like in your system:

### Ubuntu

Here is the Neofetch command that I use with this profile:

```
neofetch --source ~/ascii/katana --ascii_colors 0 7
```

### Powershell
